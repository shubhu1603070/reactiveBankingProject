# reactiveBankingProject
This project i created from scratch using the reactive Web-Flux, Kafka, MongoDB, EurekaServer

This applicatiion helps you register a user / login a user
if the username / password provided is correct we get one jwt token using this token than we hit other API's which are related to account
Like update the account / delete account / get account / add money / remove money from account

Whole application is built using reactive programming i have also used little bit of reactive kafka i'm learning it as i learn i'll add more kafka in repositories
Also it uses eureka server LB
